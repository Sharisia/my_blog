    <p>Ive spent my life recovering from things</p>
    <p>that i should have been protected from.</p><br>
    <p>I was too young to become a ghost full of grief,</p>
    <p>Chilred are supposed to be happy and free.</p><br>
    <p>don't tell me I wouldn't be who I am today,</p>
    <p>without all the struggles that I faced.</p><br>
    <p>I already know that. I could have been a kid</p>
    <p>instead of being forced to grow up.</p><br>
    <p>the people who were supposed to protect me,</p>
    <p>failed me. no amount of healing will change that</p><br>
    <p>damn right I'm crazy</p>
    <p>I'll never get my childhood back.</p><br>
